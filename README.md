# Movie Box Office Revenue Prediction

This project aims to predict the overall worldwide box office revenue for movies using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains metadata on over 7,000 past films from The Movie Database which is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction). By analyzing factors such as cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries, we seek to understand what influences a movie's financial success at the box office.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes the following data points:

- **Cast and Crew:** Information about the actors, directors, writers, and other crew members involved in the movie.
-  **Plot Keywords:** Keywords that describe the movie's plot or genre.
- **Budget:** The estimated budget for producing the movie.
- **Posters:** Images and visual assets associated with the movie.
- **Release Dates:** Information about the release dates of the movie in various countries.
- **Languages:** The languages in which the movie is available.
-  **Production Companies:** The production companies involved in making the movie.
- **Countries:** The countries where the movie was produced or released
